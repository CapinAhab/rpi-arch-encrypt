# Archlinux arm on raspberry pi with encryption

A install script to setup Archlinux arm with disk encryption.

⚠️ **Warning:**
Archlinux arm (Alarm) is still technically maintained but is wildly unstable at time of writing . I'm not maintaining this repository or working on this project any more however if your looking for something similar my [Void Linux](https://github.com/CapinAhab/rpi-void-linux-encrypt) encryption project.
